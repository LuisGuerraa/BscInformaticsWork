# Project developed for Design Patterns (Java) Course 

## Overview:

The objective of this project is to get board games information from an api in different ways always using Java language and packages.  
This project is done in 3 parts : using Iterator and Iterable interfaces; using Streams from JDK and finally using "reactive streams" from reactiveiox and asynchronous programming. 
For the asynchronous part check this for more documentation -> https://github.com/javasync/idioms .
This project uses https://www.boardgameatlas.com/api/ api to get information about games, their categories and artists. It's all about queries and effiency of the infrastructures and technology used.
