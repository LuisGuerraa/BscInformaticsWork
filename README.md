# My Work

## Brief overview
Hey! Welcome to my repository where i show you some of my projects done in the context of [Informatics](https://isel.pt/cursos/licenciaturas/engenharia-informatica-e-de-computadores) course at [ISEL](https://isel.pt/). The following examples of projects are not all i've done but are the most fun and interactive that i did. In addition to these projects i also worked on projects that were developed in [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/getting-started/)([CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Infrastructure),[CLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime), [CIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language) and .NET), [Assembly x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language), [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). Assembly x86 code was written and executed on PDS16, an experimental processor provided by ISEL. In another course i made an application in which it was 50% java code and the other 50% programming on hardware like PAL's with WinCupl and LCD displays which the final objective was making a working time recorder, you can see that in WorkingTimeRecorder folder but make sure you don't laugh at the code, it was on the early stages of the course.. 
Other courses that donÂ´t make sense to add here but are worth mentioning were CyberSecurity,Computer Networks (Cisco), Algorithims and Data Strucutures. 

## Some apps developed by me and some colleagues throughout the course:

### 2nd semester -> WorkingTimeRecorder ([JAVA](https://www.java.com) and [WinCupl](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/spld-cplds/pld-design-resources))
### 3rd semester -> Boardstar ([JAVA](https://www.java.com))
### 4th semester -> University Manager ([JAVA](https://www.java.com) and deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/))
### 5th semester -> COTA & CIBORG ([JavaScript](https://javascript.info/) with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on the server-side and [HTML](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)/[CSS](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) on the front-side)
### 5th semester -> Drag ([Android](https://developer.android.com/) framework)
### 6th semester -> Projects Manager ([Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) with [Spring](https://spring.io/) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/))
