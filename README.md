# My Work

## Brief overview
Hey! Welcome to my repository where I show you some of my projects done in the context of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://isel.pt/cursos/licenciaturas/engenharia-informatica-e-de-computadores) degree at [ISEL](https://isel.pt/). The following examples of projects are not all i've done but are the most fun and interactive that i did. In addition to these projects i also worked on projects that were developed in [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/getting-started/)([CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Infrastructure),[CLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime), [CIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language) and .NET), [Assembly x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language), [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). Assembly x86 code was written and executed on PDS16, an experimental processor provided by ISEL.
In the "Docs" folder you can find some of other course's coding (specified in each sub-folder) as well as some reports of more theorical courses.

Hope you enjoy! If you have any concerns or questions don't hesitate to reach me!
